## Interfacing touchpad

*Help in identifying the touchpad controller chip. Couldn't even find the manufacturer based on the logo.*


- Data and clock logic capture from moving a finger over the touchpad is available.
- Clock frequency seems to be 12kHz, but I don't know the protocol (though that doesn't prove much at all x).
